      <description>I have a web domain currently hosted by Google and I&amp;rsquo;m looking to transfer it to a private hosting service. As part of this process, I need assistance with migrating all email messages to ensure no data is lost.&#xA;Additionally, I need help reviewing my Google Drive to delete unnecessary files, organize the needed data into folders, and save it securely to my computer.&#xA;The ideal candidate will have experience with Google Workspace, including Gmail and Google Drive, and should be skilled in email migration, domain transfers, and data organization.</description>
